# Phone input number component with Shadcn&nbsp;UI

This is a demo of a custom phone number component built with Shadcn UI. Feel free to play around with it and customize it to your needs.

<div class="not-prose">
  <SocialLink
    href="https://github.com/armandsalle/my-site/tree/main/src/react/phone-input/index.tsx"
    title="Github"
    username="Get the code here"
    logoUrl="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"
  ></SocialLink>
</div>

You will need some extra packages to make this works.

```bash
npm install libphonenumber-js i18n-iso-countries react-phone-number-input
```

Don't forget to register the local you want.

```javascript
import { registerLocale } from "i18n-iso-countries"
// The local you want
import enCountries from "i18n-iso-countries/langs/en.json"
registerLocale(enCountries)
```

<PhoneInputShadcnUiPhoneInput client:load />
